@article{Sato2000,
abstract = {In randomized clinical trials, non‐compliance will lead to the loss of power in the standard intention‐to‐treat analysis and one should account for this in sample size calculations. In this paper a new sample size formula for a binary outcome is proposed in which compliance information is considered. The proposed method is based purely on the treatment randomization. We compare it to the conventional sample size calculation method based on the two independent binomial distributions assumption. We examine 3100 combinations of risks of control group (baseline risks), treatment effects (risk differences), compliances in the test treatment group and the control treatment group, test sizes and powers. We found that, compared to the conventional method, the proposed method gives similar sample sizes for baseline risks 0.4–0.6, larger sample sizes for baseline risks less than 0.4, and smaller sample sizes for baseline risks greater than 0.6 when the true risk difference is negative.

@article{Lachin1986,
abstract = {When designing a clinical trial to test the equality of survival distributions for two treatment groups, the usual assumptions are exponential survival, uniform patient entry, full compliance, and censoring only administratively at the end of the trial. Various authors have presented methods for estimation of sample size or power under these assumptions, some of which allow for an R-year accrual period with T total years of study, T > R. The method of Lachin (1981, Controlled Clinical Trials 2, 93-113) is extended to allow for cases where patients enter the trial in a nonuniform manner over time, patients may exit from the trial due to loss to follow-up (other than administrative), other patients may continue follow-up although failing to comply with the treatment regimen, and a stratified analysis may be planned according to one or more prognostic covariates.},

@article{Whitehead1993,
abstract = {Many clinical trials yield data on an ordered categorical scale such as very good, good, moderate, poor. Under the assumption of proportional odds, such data can be analysed using techniques of logistic regression. In simple comparisons of two treatments this approach becomes equivalent to the Mann–Whitney test. In this paper sample size formulae consistent with an eventual logistic regression analysis are derived. The influence on efficiency of the number and breadth of categories will be examined. Effects of misclassification and of stratification are discussed, and examples of the calculations are given.},
